# MuliprogrammingOperatingSystem
Simulating Operating System using in multiprogramming environment using paging and memory management scheme.

This multiprogramming Operating system is coded in Java using Eclipse IDE (4.5). The input is a file containing 106 Hexdecimal Jobs, an the output to each program is a single execution_profile, which contains the output to each program and the logs of the system captured periodically. It also displays the trace files for each Job whose trace bits are enabled.

To handler the errors/Warnings in the Operating System, Error Handler is implemented which captures the errors injected in the user input job. To test the Error handler, more 106 were created ,out of which ramdomely a few programs were injected with error and the error handler was checked.
